# OMG Flask Web Application
This is a webapp for a barbershop. 
Customers have to make appointments online and the admin has to be responsible by responding and confirming these appointments. The system has a database whick keeps track of all these records.

# HOW TO RUN.
You can just download the project but what i highly recommend is to clone the repo if you want to run, code, debug or test the project.
The Flask_WebApp folder has code and the System_Design has all other documents.

# LIBRARIES USED
This is very critical to understand as you will easily understand the sorce code and will not get confused on what is going on if the tell you xyz... is not installed.
1. Application : Flask
2. Database : Sqlite3 (soon be using SQLAlchemy)
3. Python + Html : Jinja
4. Debug database with tables: tabulate
:> You can install these libraries with just the command "pip install library_name" and you should be good to go. Also note Jinja comes with flask in most cases.
